    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit casserole is a quick and easy breakfast for the whole family.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16.3 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits (such as Pillsbury Grands! Original)</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Line prepared baking dish with the biscuits, pressing to form an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (Leave the oven door open for a bit to let the oven cool down.)</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage to skillet; cook and stir until fully cooked and browned, about 10 minutes; drain fat. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle cooked sausage and cheese evenly over baked biscuits. </li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Pour egg mixture over sausage and cheese. (The egg mixture won't cover the cheese and sausage at this point, but will expand as it bakes.)</li>
        <li>Bake until casserole is set and internal temperature registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
